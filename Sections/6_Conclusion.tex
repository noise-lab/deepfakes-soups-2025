\section{Conclusion}
Generative AI has shifted the online information ecosystem and necessitates a corresponding shift in the way platforms govern online content to address the ways AI-generated content cause harms to online trust and safety. While researchers are addressing many facets of how AI-generated content is changing how we create, consume, interact with, and distribute content, we outlined how some harms from AI-generated content to trust and safety such as managing debates around content ownership and monetization still need to be addressed. To get ahead of these changes and create safer online environments for all, we have recommended that researchers, policymakers, developers, and platforms take action to ensure the responsible creation and use of AI-generative content. This space is rapidly evolving and by keeping ahead of these changes, we can improve online governance more broadly.
