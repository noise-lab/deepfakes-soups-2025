abstract = {AI systems powered by large language models can act as capable assistants for writing and editing. In these tasks, the AI system acts as a co-creative partner, making novel contributions to an artifact-under-creation alongside its human partner(s). One question that arises in these scenarios is the extent to which AI should be credited for its contributions. We examined knowledge workers’ views of attribution through a survey study (N=155) and found that they assigned different levels of credit across different contribution types, amounts, and initiative. Compared to a human partner, we observed a consistent pattern in which AI was assigned less credit for equivalent contributions. Participants felt that disclosing AI involvement was important and used a variety of criteria to make attribution judgments, including the quality of contributions, personal values, and technology considerations. Our results motivate and inform new approaches for crediting AI contributions to co-created work.},

abstract = {While different countries vary in their determination of copyrightability, jurisdictions like the United States currently do not allow an artist to copyright AI-generated content when they do not have creative control. One avenue for an author to support their case for copyright protections over work created with AI may then be to demonstrate their intent to “predict” outputs of the generative AI tool during the creation process, shifting elements of randomness from the AI to the human’s own decision-making as much as possible. When this happens, the artist might claim to have expressed their idea with generative AI, and seek copyright protection for their work. We propose that generative AI co-creation tools can support this intention by keeping records of the predictability statistics at each generative AI iteration, and capturing the potential alternate options that can be later assessed for how predictably they matched the prompt.},
